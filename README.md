Two copies of the state space are included for problem 1 in case one is too grainy. The flat one is more logical but
the square one may have better resolution.

To run the program for problem 3:
Navigate to the directory with the miller.py file in it.
Start a python shell.
Import command 'import miller'.
Run with miller.driver(n,k), where n is the number you're testing for primality, and k is the number times to run the test.
